# Rust Ray Tracing

The goal of this repo is to build a play ray tracer using rust.

Heavily inspired by [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

### Why?

- I've never used Rust before
- I've never built a ray tracer from scratch
- Hopefully can be used as a playground to investigate other fun things like WASM, WebGL, etc
